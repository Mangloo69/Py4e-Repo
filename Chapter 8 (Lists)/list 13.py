# Lists are in order

# - A list can hold many items and keeps those items in the order until we do somthing to change the order
# - A list can be sorted (i.e., change its order)
# - The sort method (unlike strings) means "sort yourself"

friends = ["Joseph", "Glenn", "Sally"]
friends.sort()
print(friends)
print(friends[1])
